# Smart-Plug-for-Smart-Scheduling-and-Monitoring

I've been working on this project, where I have to design a Smart Plug Set which monitors AC power and continuously uploads data to the cloud for processing. This consists of a Master Plug that connects to all the Slave Plugs and requests data from them periodically and uploads this data to the cloud.
